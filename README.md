# Peasant Unrest and Imperial Repression in Russia

This repository contains the data, code, and analysis for a research project investigating the causes of peasant unrest and the logic of imperial repression in late imperial Russia. The project integrates diverse archival datasets, replicates existing studies, and provides new empirical models to understand state responses to bottom-up threats.

## Project Overview

- **Research Focus**: How did historical legacies (serfdom, land inequality, urbanization) and social unrest shape the geography and logic of state repression in Russia prior to 1917?  
- **Core Questions**:  
  - What factors predicted where the Okhrana (imperial secret police) directed its repressive efforts?  
  - How did peasant unrest interact with economic structure, inequality, and the legacy of serfdom?
  - Can historical models of state repression be empirically validated using modern quantitative methods?

The analysis draws on the replication and extension of datasets from recent political science and economic history literature (see Data Sources below).

## Structure

- `analysis/data_building/`: Scripts and Quarto/LaTeX docs for preprocessing and merging raw data, including land inequality, occupation structure, serfdom, and unrest events.
- `analysis/models/`: Modelling scripts and outputs (Quarto, LaTeX) for statistical analysis of repression, unrest, and regional characteristics.
- `data/data_raw/`: Raw data from published sources and archival work (tab-delimited, Stata, R, Excel).
- `data/data_built/`: Cleaned and merged datasets for modelling (autogenerated).
- `utilities/`: Project utilities (dependency checks, artifact cleaning).
- `paper/`: Main research paper and figures.

## Data Sources

- **Peasant Unrest**: Events from Finkel et al., "Does Reform Prevent Rebellion? Evidence From Russia's Emancipation of the Serfs" ([Harvard Dataverse](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/29018)).
- **Representation and Repression**: Dower et al., "Collective Action and Representation in Autocracies: Evidence from Russia's Great Reforms" ([Cambridge](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0003055417000454)).
- **Okhrana Cases**: Grigoriadis et al., geolocated Okhrana repression events.
- **Land Inequality, Urbanization, Serfdom**: Assembled from historical census, land registers, and research literature.

## Key Analysis Steps

- **Data Building**: [analysis/data_building/data_building.qmd](analysis/data_building/data_building.qmd) and [analysis/data_building/data_building.tex](analysis/data_building/data_building.tex) describe merging, cleaning, and transforming raw sources into analysis-ready data.
- **Modelling**: [analysis/models/models.qmd](analysis/models/models.qmd) and [analysis/models/models.tex](analysis/models/models.tex) provide regression models linking peasant unrest, land inequality, serfdom, and Okhrana repressionâ€”controlling for urbanization and industrialization.
- **Paper**: [paper/paper.tex](paper/paper.tex) contains the main research article, including theoretical framework, data description, modelling results, and discussion.

## How to Use

1. **Dependencies**:  
   - R (tested on 4.x), Quarto, LaTeX (TeX Live or similar), Deno (for cleaning utilities).
2. **Install and check packages** (in R):  
   ```r
   source("utilities/check_packages.R")
   ```
3. **Build Data**:  
   ```bash
   quarto render analysis/data_building/data_building.qmd
   ```
4. **Run Models**:  
   ```bash
   quarto render analysis/models/models.qmd
   ```
5. **Render Paper**:  
   Compile `paper/paper.tex` using your LaTeX setup.
