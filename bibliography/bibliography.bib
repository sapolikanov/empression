Before the emancipation, provinces where serfs constituted the majority of agricultural laborers lagged behind provinces that primarily relied on free labor. The emancipation led to a significant but partial catch up. Better incentives of peasants resulting from the cessation of ratchet effect were a likely mechanism behind a relatively fast positive effect of reform on agricultural productivity. The land reform, which instituted communal land tenure after the emancipation, diminished growth in productivity in repartition communes.},

A micro-level analysis that employs a broader set of measures of well-being for a small rural region in central Russia suggests that, contrary to previous findings, living standards were improving throughout the nineteenth century, even in seemingly less dynamic rural areas. Moreover, the variation in income and consumption patterns, human-capital development, and the distribution of resources in the countryside was greater than typically assumed. Since state and local institutions might be able to account for it, these determinants should be emphasized in future analyses of rural living standards in pre-Soviet Russia.},

Employing data on the intensity of labor coercion just prior to emancipation in 1861, we document that a 25 percentage point increase in historical serfdom (1 {SD}) reduces household expenditure today by up to 17\%. We then provide evidence on the persistence of this relationship by studying city populations over the period 1800 to 2002. Exploring mechanisms, our findings suggest that less urban agglomeration and slower industrial development in areas with a greater degree of serfdom perpetuated the negative effects of forced labor before, during, and after the Soviet period.},

Our primary empirical exercise relates peasant representation in new institutions of local self-government to the frequency of peasant unrest in the decade prior to reform. To correct for measurement error in the unrest data and other sources of endogeneity, we exploit idiosyncratic variation in two determinants of peasant unrest: the historical incidence of serfdom and religious polarization. We ﬁnd that peasants were granted less representation in districts with more frequent unrest in preceding years—a relationship consistent with the {AcemogluRobinson} model of political transitions and inconsistent with numerous other theories of institutional change. At the same time, we observe patterns of redistribution in subsequent years that are inconsistent with the commitment mechanism central to the Acemoglu-Robinson model. Building on these results, we discuss possible directions for future theoretical work.},

What enabled this distinctive form of political organization and collective action that has proved so durable and influential? The answer has typically been sought either in the realm of ideas, in the Western tradition of individual rights, or in material change, especially the complex interaction of war, taxes, and economic growth. Common to these strands is the belief that representation resulted from weak ruling powers needing to concede rights to powerful social groups. Boucoyannis argues instead that representative institutions were a product of state strength, specifically the capacity to deliver justice across social groups. Enduring and inclusive representative parliaments formed when rulers could exercise power over the most powerful actors in the land and compel them to serve and, especially, to tax them. The language of rights deemed distinctive to the West emerged in response to more effectively imposed collective obligations, especially on those with most power.},

	abstract = {Contemporary models of political economy suggest that reforms intended to reduce grievances should curtail unrest, a perspective at odds with many traditional accounts of reform and rebellion. We explore the impact of reform on rebellion with a new data set on peasant disturbances in 19th-century Russia. Using a difference-in-differences design that exploits the timing of various peasant reforms, we document a large increase in disturbances among former serfs following the Emancipation Reform of 1861, a development counter to reformers’ intent. Our analysis suggests that this outcome was driven by peasants’ disappointment with the reform’s design and implementation—the consequence of elite capture in the context of a generally weak state—and heightened expectations of what could be achieved through coordinated action. Reform-related disturbances were most pronounced in provinces where commune organization facilitated collective action and where fertile soil provoked contestation over land.},

	url = {https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/land-inequality-industrialization-unrest-evidence/docview/2450173996/se-2?accountid=14501},
	abstract = {Why is economic development, despite being beneficial for society as a whole, often associated with political instability? Can the redistributional effects of industrialization lead to more intense conflict? These issues have been important for most agrarian countries undergoing rapid economic transformation, and are still relevant. Nevertheless, there are few attempts to address them using the toolbox of contemporary social science.This dissertation seeks to address these problems in the historical context of the late Russian Empire—a country experiencing rapid economic progress simultaneously with mounting popular discontent, which paved the way for its ruinous demise. Focusing on the dynamics of peasant unrest, I argue that industrialization could have an ambiguous effect on the intensity of conflict due to two opposing forces: expanding non-agricultural employment opportunities (labor absorption), which mitigated peasant demand for land, and greater competition for local natural resources, acting in the opposite direction. The net effect of industrialization depended on which of these two mechanisms prevailed, which itself was determined by the structure of industrial development. Moreover, this process could also affect the magnitude of the positive impact of land inequality on conflict, making peasants more or less sensitive to disparities between private and communal landholding.My theory builds on the existing literature on the political economy of development and ample historical evidence from the Russian Empire. First, I analyze the case of a large-scale peasant uprising in 1902 in the Poltava and Kharkov provinces, located in the south-west of the Russian Empire. The hotbed of the uprising was the territory occupied by a huge commercialized and industrialized estate increasingly reliant on large-scale tenants, who either cultivated the land formerly available to the peasants or sublet it at higher rates. The villages suffering particularly severe land shortages played the most important role at the onset of the uprising. The district where it started had the lowest share of land communally owned by the peasants. Notably, mass looting and property destruction also targeted sugar refineries. The logic of conflict between peasants and landlords is illustrated with the help of a formal model, which supports my theoretical intuition: commercialization and greater productivity of large-scale landownership and the lack of outside options for the peasantry engaged in subsistence farming may make conflict more likely.I test my theory with a quantitative analysis of district-level panel data for the European part of the Russian Empire from 1879 to 1904. As expected, the association of land inequality and unrest is positive: a lower share of allotment land (in communal ownership of the peasants), as opposed to state and private land, is associated with higher peasant unrest. The relationship between overall industrialization and peasant unrest is often negative, but typically insignificant, whereas its interaction with land inequality is positive, which means that it could decrease the negative association between allotment land and conflict, reducing peasants’ sensitivity to the availability of land due to the prevalence of the labor absorption effect.The results are also largely consistent with my theoretical expectations if we consider different industries separately. Food processing, for which it is possible to expect the prevalence of resource competition over the labor absorption channel, was associated with higher unrest, and strengthened the relationship between land distribution and conflict. The opposite is true for the textiles industry, which employed local labor, but used externally sourced raw materials. My sub-district analysis of the 1905–1906 peasant unrest in the Kursk province, located in the fertile black soil region in Southern Russia, mostly supports these conclusions, especially with respect to the role of the food industry and, more specifically, sugar refining.Exploring a relatively understudied topic, this dissertation makes a valuable theoretical and empirical contribution to studies of conflict and the political economy of development. Combining different methods and types of evidence, complementing indepth case studies with broad-based quantitative analysis, it produces a comprehensive picture of the determinants of peasant unrest generalizable to other world regions and time periods. It also considerably enriches our knowledge of the history of the late Russian Empire and the prerequisites for the social and political upheaval that caused its collapse. My data collection effort, which produced two novel quantitative datasets containing district-level information on peasant unrest, industrial development, land inequality, and other socio-economic indicators in the Russian Empire in the last decades of its existence and, at a less aggregated level, in one of its provinces, will hopefully be valuable to other historians and social scientists in future work.},

Different social groups prefer different political institutions because of the way they allocate political power and resources. Thus democracy is preferred by the majority of citizens, but opposed by elites. Dictatorship nevertheless is not stable when citizens can threaten social disorder and revolution. In response, when the costs of repression are sufficiently high and promises of concessions are not credible, elites may be forced to create democracy. By democratizing, elites credibly transfer political power to the citizens, ensuring social stability. Democracy consolidates when elites do not have strong incentive to overthrow it. These processes depend on (1) the strength of civil society, (2) the structure of political institutions, (3) the nature of political and economic crises, (4) the level of economic inequality, (5) the structure of the economy, and (6) the form and extent of globalization.},
